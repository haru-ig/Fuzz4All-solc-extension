/** @dev MutateSemanticEquivalentEfficientDynamicArrayType1bMutator function is required to allow nested dynamic arrays to be realigned. (Dynamic arrays in Solidity are arrays where the size is not defined at the time of declaration but rather can be changed at runtime as more elements are added, making them flexible for various purposes. Several instances were given, such as assigning an array without any elements, pre-filling the array with values, and initializing with the new keyword. )

There have been a couple of bugs related to dynamic arrays in the past. The first bug, "NestedCalldataArrayAbiReencodingSizeValidation", concerned ABI-reencoding of nested dynamic calldata arrays which did not always perform correct size checks. They
