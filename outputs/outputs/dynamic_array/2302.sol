/* Please create a small program which uses all four array assignments to create and empty array, and assigns a value to one and two, respectively.
We recommend that you modify each assignment so that it would result in two arrays that are identical (except for one, which might contain random data, like in the case of arrayOne).
You also should modify each assignment so that modifying one variable would invalidate the whole array on the three lines below.

Please note that due to the nature of nesting, you cannot use arrays directly in contract code to access or
