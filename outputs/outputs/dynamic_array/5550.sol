This example program illustrates the need for dynamic arrays and the potential for bugs. If you
have already got a dynamic array in your code, it might be better to just use the existing array.
If you want that array to be populated by contract code that might be an even better idea.

To understand what the problem looks like better practice using this example - this example was modified to use a dynamic array.
When the value of an indexed mapping is accessed, Solidity first looks the array, then the mapping. In this way the access can be done without an additional variable declaration.

If the memory layout of an array is not clear, try to look up in the standard library, and read some of the articles that we recommend from the documentation.

Dynamic arrays are extremely common today and you may find them a major enhancement to the Solidity language.

As an example of an array that is not dynamic - it is created with the "new" keyword. Dynamic arrays must be initialized with the same data type and length (same as the number of elements in the array). The elements can then be accessed directly using their respective "address" types. To initialize a dynamic array with a uint - 12 - do:

Uint[] myArray = new Uint[](12);
dynamic memory a = Uint(12);
In this way, the elements are accessed directly. It is also important to understand that Uint arrays get erased if the capacity is less than a contract's current contract's state size. In some cases, the contract's current state size will be bigger than the maximum size of a dynamic array, so erasing the array does not have to be explicitly done (unlike with an array with length 10) and is not included in this function.

You can also create dynamic arrays that fill to the given length by using the "fill" method. This method allows assigning dynamic variables without constant expressions at the expense of slower code. The following example shows how to use this method to create a dynamic array with variable length:

Uint[ ]myArray2 = new Uint[](
