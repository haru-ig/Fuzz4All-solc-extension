* @dev The previous generation contains a huge number of bugs that cause the code to be
 * very inefficient and complicated to understand. Over the years we’ve added features so that
 * the code is easier to understand and debug. In particular you can now write code which is
 * significantly more structured and self-describing, even if that means dramatically worse
 * performance compared to the previous generations. The new features add significant
 * value in the long term and the new code is much easier to follow and maintain. The next six
 * generations also cover a huge part of the market space which we call “EIPs.”
 *
 * The new features are not meant to be substitutes for existing features or to serve a
 * future proof solution. For that reason all changes are made to contracts with the "0x1F" prefix
 * throughout the history of the compiler. All new functionality is also added to the "0x1F"
 * standard in a way that has not been possible in v0. The "0xE" prefix is reserved for internal
 * use. The "0xF" prefix is reserved for a future standard that might be changed or removed from the contract
 * compiler in different ways. */
