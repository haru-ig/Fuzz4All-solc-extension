## The Future of Statements
The solidity compiler will continue to work towards the upcoming smart contract development environment, this is particularly important in the Ethereum blockchain.
***
## New Features
All new solidity statements will be checked by the language with a pre-computed check. The pre-computed check eliminates the need to manually provide state of non-volatile memory during execution.
***
## Removal of Block Statements
The solidity compiler will continue to work towards the upcoming smart contract development environment, the removal of block statements is a clear benefit of state manipulation.
