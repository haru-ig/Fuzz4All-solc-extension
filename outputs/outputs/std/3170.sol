1. `Array.sol`: This contract provides functions for handling arrays of unsigned and signed integers. It includes functions for finding the minimum, maximum, and sum of array elements, setting and getting the array, and sorting the array.

2. `Convert.sol`: This contract provides helper functions for converting between strings and unsigned integers.

3. `Math.sol`: This contract provides basic mathematical functions, including square root and modular exponentiation.

4. `Memory.sol`: This contract provides low-level memory access functions. It includes functions for getting the address of an array and returning the array pointed by a given address. It should be used with caution due to potential security risks.

5. `Multiprecision.sol`: This contract provides functions for floating-point calculations with adjustable precision. It includes functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as comparison operations.

6. `Random.sol`: This contract provides a random number generator based on the SHA3 function. It includes functions for generating random unsigned integers and arrays of random bytes. Note that it is not cryptographically secure.
