## Conclusion

In this article, I presented a brief overview of Solidity, and covered a brief summary of each Solidity component that is important to understand regarding its implementation. I used Solidity to create a program that can multiply two numbers, find the sum of two numbers, set and get an element of an array, and perform basic mathematical operations and manipulations. If you have time at the end of this article, you can extend the code in `Multiply.sol` and start playing with it!
