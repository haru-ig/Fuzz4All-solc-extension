`contract Mutated_2_3_3` is still a contract with a single declared `constructor` method. But now it has two declared `modifier`.

As can be seen from their code, in this mutation, `var myValue` becomes `var myValue = var (uint256(0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF) + uint256(0))`, the result of multiplying `uint256(0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF) and uint256(0)` is `uint256(0)` because of `uint256(0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF)` being larger than `uint256(0x0)`, so the result of the calculation is `-1`.

This mutation will introduce a bug, which is a type error that will appear in the compiler. In this moment `uint256` contains a number with over 2^256 values, hence it overflows out. To solve this, we use the `uint256(0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF)` method to cast everything up to `2^256 - 1`, which will return an error that `uint256` cannot hold a negative value. If it was possible, it would have been possible for `uint256` to hold a negative value. If we allow negative values, it would result in a greater amount of data that would make a contract very unsafe to exploit and deploy in the wild. The `uint256` type has no negative limits, however, so it is still necessary to allow negative values for `uint256`. Therefore, as long as the underlying type of the contract doesn't allow negative values, it is still possible to use the contract in an environment where this is not possible.

1.  This mutation is used by Solidity to exploit its bug-free nature. Solidity uses the `unsafe` keyword when it modifies the contract to remove bugs.

2.  The method `min(uint x, uint y)` in `Mutated_2_3_3.sol` returns an `uint` number with value of `uint256(0)`. This method is being used in the `add(uint, uint)` method for adding a value to two unsigned numbers, so `min(uint(0), uint(10))` is equal to `10` in Solidity. This code is still technically correct, since it returns the same result as `uint(0) + uint(10)` when `uint(0) >= uint(10)`, which is 10.
