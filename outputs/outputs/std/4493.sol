pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
contract MyContract {
	S s;
	constructor() {
		s.x;
		}
	}
```

**Notes:**

A more practical (but less intuitive) way to get to your conclusions in this exercise is to start with the `Arrays` contract and try to understand its functionality. Use this method to build the `Multiprecision` contract; use this method to build the `Math` contract. Create a program which uses new Solidity features in a complex way, but don't use a new datastructure. Use the `Arrays.sol` and `Memory.sol` contracts in the above code.
