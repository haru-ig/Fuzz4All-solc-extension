As an Ethereum developer, inline assembly is a powerful tool and a fundamental one in Solidity. Inline assembly is a feature that allows you to write code that interfaces directly with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It gives programmers more control and can be useful for performing tasks like writing libraries or optimizing gas usage. This feature uses a language known as Yul.

Important points:
- Inline assembly blocks are initiated by assembly { â€¦ }, and the code inside the braces uses the Yul language.
- Inline assembly allows for fine-tuned control over the EVM but bypasses important safety features; it should only be used by experienced developers.
- Using inline assembly, developers
