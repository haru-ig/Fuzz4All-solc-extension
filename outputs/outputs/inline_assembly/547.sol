<title>Solidity Inline Assembly Examples</title>
<h1>Solidity Inline Assembly Examples</h1>
<p>The language of Solidity is written in Yul, which is known both as a high-level and low-level language. This means that in many ways Yul is very similar to and equivalent to C. Yul is also not the same as C-like languages, in that it can be used on small subsets of the EVM.
</p><p>Anyone who has a high-level programming background should be able to translate Yul to C. Most programming frameworks/libraries should be able to translate Yul into C as well (such as the Solidity compiler that generates Solidity on the EVM).
</p><p>The following examples use Yul with inline assembly, just as C. If the examples don't work, be sure to search for the source on GitHub to see what could be wrong.</p>
