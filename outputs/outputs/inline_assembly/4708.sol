# [Remix](https:

Remix is an open-source IDE for Solidity. The language and environment in which you write code is exactly the same as with an IDE. This IDE is built on top of Ethereum JavaScript API that translates source code to a compiled executable. So, Remix can be used to write EVM code or a combination of EVM code and JavaScript.

For more information on Remix, check this page or its article from Remix.io.

# Codepen

Codepen is an online HTML editor built by developers that allows you to include Solidity in your web page. You can include this code directly on the page, or copy it and paste it into your IDE.

You can make changes to any Solidity code on Codepen.

Codepen also serves as a starting point for developing and debugging smart contracts. It also allows you to collaborate with others on Solidity code.

Codepen is a great online IDE to use for learning and test on Solidity.

# [Etherscan](https:

Etherscan is a website built by a team of web developers that allows you to view your smart contracts as a decentralized application without having to request or access or hold a wallet. Here, you can search your smart contracts, find your functions, return the function addresses, and view the details about those functions. When you connect your wallet, you're able to send or retrieve Ethereum transactions and view Ether balances. These features make Etherscan an ideal tool for learning, testing, and debugging your blockchain smart contracts.

Etherscan is a great way for learning and testing smart contracts, and also for knowing whether your smart contract is deployed and working correctly.

If you're looking into deploying your smart contract using Remix, the Remix contract explorer is more effective, so you can do more transactions and operations in Etherscan.
