pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
contract ConstantAccessBlock01 {
    uint constant constantA = 0;
    uint constant constantB = 10;
    function test() public pure {
        uint _var1;
        assembly {
            _var1 := constantA
            constantB := constantB

        require(_var1 <= 2 && constantB >= 3);
    }
}
```
It prints:
```
The contract constantAccessBlock01.test() has a known unknown, unsolved bug.
```

It looks like this bug is not present because the constant `0` is read at the assembly line 1. `0x0` is not printed as hex, and the assembly language takes the value of `0` as 0 and prints. However, if I replace the `0` with 0x0, the bug is found. 0x0 is a decimal number, and it's printed out as 0. 0 is a hexadecimal number, as it's printed as this in hex.

To overcome this bug in this example, it's required that the constant is initialized with the hex value 0x0. The next line is executed to set the constant. Then, the bug is found:
```
// This is the bug in a smart contract
// In the second code block, it's read the value of 10 instead of 0x0.

```

Note that there is no problem with accessing the local variables inside the contract. If it were used, the contract would be not compiled because the contract would be marked as having a contract that has the variables inside a public function. In that case, only the function is made public, but the contract code is still executable. If a contract is supposed to be used in a program, it should be marked as public, and the contract code should be marked as immutable.

If the compiler is unable to automatically fix this bug in the smart contract, there is still the option to manually fix it. The method is to do this by using the `asm()` function. With this function, you can give to it a new value (this can be any value). In the second example this is done by doing something like `asm("calldatacopy(0x20, 32)")`. As the contract already has a variable pointing to the value 32, this new value for 32 is added to the value of `0x20`.
