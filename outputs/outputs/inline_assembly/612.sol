            <p>You are invited to participate in the Ethereum Ecosystem Improvement program for the Ethereum Foundation. This program will become the successor to the Ethereum Foundation’s OpenSea (“OpenSea”). This program enables the community to provide feedback on its operation and improve its core mechanisms.</p>
<p>The general idea is to create a comprehensive list of issues to work on at the same time. You will then be given a specific set of tasks which need to be completed in order for them to be listed in OpenSea. You will be given input on various aspects of the OpenSea software, including the design and development of the software. After discussing the list of issues, you will be given the full contribution of those issues, which will be worked towards creating a full OpenSea token.</p>
<p>Our goal is that this contribution will bring OpenSea to the Ethereum ecosystem, and we will contribute code and documentation, along with technical expertise and technical expertise, to achieve this goal. We will also have the opportunity, once we know that it is complete, to give back to the community all of the code and guidance we have developed thus far.</p>
