For simplicity, the example is assumed to have these variables defined, but it is not required. Each contract can define their own fallback function if they would like different handling logic at runtime. The `fallback` function can be overloaded: if the contract has been changed to payable, the `fallback payable` function can be overloaded.

* State variable
* Constant storage variable
* Reentrancy

A contract can also keep a state variable. Each contract can only keep its own local state, so it must declare the contract as constant, which prevents data corruption. You can assign any value to the storage of the contract itself, and it will be visible inside the code. Each state variable is accessible from the outside of the contract using the `_` keyword.

Constant state variables are declared by using the `constant` keyword:
```Solidity

uint16 constant myStateVariable = 0;
```

Each state variable starts with an underscore and it can be assigned to different types of variables, and stored in non-constant storage.

For example, the following examples use the `_` to access local variables:
```Solidity
uint16 y = 0;
y = 10;
```
However, since it is defined as constant, it cannot be modified:
```Solidity
uint16 y = 0;
y += 10;
```

Note that the storage of a regular variable is accessible from the outside using `this`. For state variables this is not working as expected and so a state variable is declared as a constant:
```Solidity


uint16 constant MyClassStateVariable = 0;

contract MyClass
{
    uint16 myStateVariable_;
    uint y_;

    constructor()
      {
        myStateVariable_ = 0;
      }







    function setY_(uint n)
      {
        y_ = n;
        myStateVariable_ = n;
      }

    function myStateVariable() public view {
        return myStateVariable_;
    }
}
```
