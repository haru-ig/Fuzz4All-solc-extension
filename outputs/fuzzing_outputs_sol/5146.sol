## Solidity

Solidity is a programming language developed by <NAME>. It is designed to be a straightforward, safe and flexible development environment for writing and maintaining high-level abstractions over complex logic.

Solidity is a high-level programming language that works with the EVM to allow developers and companies to write smart contracts, to execute logic, and to deploy them to the network.

Solidity is based on the most modern programming paradigms, and is open source and free. Soon we will start with smart contracts.

Solidity is the development environment for Blockchain, a distributed ledger or distributed computing system.

If you are a blockchain developer, you will find a smart contract a powerful tool that allows you to build a complex solution.

A program can contain multiple contracts. A contract is a program that consists of a function with specified data, parameters, and data storage. A contract can be deployed to the network and contains several contracts.

A contract has several modifiers, which are used to control the operation of contracts in a way that doesn't require knowledge of the contract itself. Modifiers can be written in low-level assembly, or in Java, and then interpreted into the low-level bytecode, which is called the abstract machine language (assembly). Modifiers are functions that are executed during an execution step, and, as a result, can return different values.
