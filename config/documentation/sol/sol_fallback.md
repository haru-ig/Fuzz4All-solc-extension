Fallback Function

A contract can have at most one fallback function, declared using either fallback () external [payable] or fallback (bytes calldata input) external [payable] returns (bytes memory output) (both without the function keyword). This function must have external visibility. A fallback function can be virtual, can override and can have modifiers.

The fallback function is executed on a call to the contract if none of the other functions match the given function signature, or if no data was supplied at all and there is no receive Ether function. The fallback function always receives data, but in order to also receive Ether it must be marked payable.

If the version with parameters is used, input will contain the full data sent to the contract (equal to msg.data) and can return data in output. The returned data will not be ABI-encoded. Instead it will be returned without modifications (not even padding).

In the worst case, if a payable fallback function is also used in place of a receive function, it can only rely on 2300 gas being available (see receive Ether function for a brief description of the implications of this).

Like any function, the fallback function can execute complex operations as long as there is enough gas passed on to it.

Warning 
A payable fallback function is also executed for plain Ether transfers, if no receive Ether function is present. It is recommended to always define a receive Ether function as well, if you define a payable fallback function to distinguish Ether transfers from interface confusions.

Note
If you want to decode the input data, you can check the first four bytes for the function selector and then you can use abi.decode together with the array slice syntax to decode ABI-encoded data: (c, d) = abi.decode(input[4:], (uint256, uint256)); Note that this should only be used as a last resort and proper functions should be used instead.
