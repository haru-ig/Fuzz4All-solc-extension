In a dynamic array in Solidity, the size of the array is not mentioned during the declaration. The size of the dynamic array can be changed during the runtime as more elements are added to the array.

The below example shows different ways in which the dynamic array can be declared.

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.10;
contract DemoContract
{
    // Dynamic Array
    uint[] public flag;

    // Dynamic Array with first 3 elements initialized
    uint[] public age = [8,15,32];

     // Dynamic Array initialized with new keyword
    int[] public num = new int[](5);

}

In past, bugs related to dynamic array were found, and below is are the examples formatted in json.

        "summary": "ABI-reencoding of nested dynamic calldata arrays did not always perform proper size checks against the size of calldata and could read beyond ``calldatasize()``.",
        "description": "Calldata validation for nested dynamic types is deferred until the first access to the nested values. Such an access may for example be a copy to memory or an index or member access to the outer type. While in most such accesses calldata validation correctly checks that the data area of the nested array is completely contained in the passed calldata (i.e. in the range [0, calldatasize()]), this check may not be performed, when ABI encoding such nested types again directly from calldata. For instance, this can happen, if a value in calldata with a nested dynamic array is passed to an external call, used in ``abi.encode`` or emitted as event. In such cases, if the data area of the nested array extends beyond ``calldatasize()``, ABI encoding it did not revert, but continued reading values from beyond ``calldatasize()`` (i.e. zero values).",

        "description": "Consider a dynamically-sized array in storage whose base-type is small enough such that multiple values can be packed into a single slot, such as `uint128[]`. Let us define its length to be `l`. When this array gets assigned from another array with a smaller length, say `m`, the slots between elements `m` and `l` have to be cleaned by zeroing them out. However, this cleaning was not performed properly. Specifically, after the slot corresponding to `m`, only the first packed value was cleaned up. If this array gets resized to a length larger than `m`, the indices corresponding to the unclean parts of the slot contained the original value, instead of 0. The resizing here is performed by assigning to the array `length`, by a `push()` or via inline assembly. You are not affected if you are only using `.push(<arg>)` or if you assign a value (even zero) to the new elements after increasing the length of the array.",

Using dynamic arrays with nested structures (e.g. arrays of arrays or mappings) increases the complexity and likelihood of bugs in edge cases or using them in low-level operations (e.g. assembly or manual memory management) might lead to subtle issues. 

Other than this, reasons that dynamic arrays might cause issues are thought to be as follows; 
Dynamic Memory Allocation:
Dynamic arrays involve memory allocation at runtime, which can be tricky to manage and may expose bugs in edge cases. For example:
Incorrect handling of array size changes.
Overflows or underflows in array resizing logic.

Interactions with Storage:
Dynamic arrays stored in contract storage can lead to more potential for bugs:
If elements are removed or resized, the underlying storage layout needs to be correctly managed.
Unused storage slots from removed elements may still consume gas or cause unexpected behaviors if reused incorrectly.
